# Exercise 06

Use Metaprogramming Programming Styles, i.e., aspects and plugins, to implement Word Index.

## Task 1: The Aspects Style

To complete this task you must use the *Aspects Style* to profile the execution of the Word Index program implemented using the Pipeline style (Lecture 02, Task 03). 

The profiling code should print summary of arguments received by functions (e.g., name, type, string version) and the time to execute the function.


## Task 2: The Plugins Style

To complete this task you must: Implement the Word Index program using the **Plugins Style**: the main file should (1) load the plugins that implement data related functions (reading data, parsing lines, etc.) and frequency computation, (2) used them to compute the word index, and (3) print the result on the console.
